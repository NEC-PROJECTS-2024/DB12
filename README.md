### INTRODUCTION
Facial recognition technology has revolutionized security and attendance tracking systems, offering a more efficient and accurate alternative to traditional methods such as signatures and biometrics [2]. This technology finds extensive application in banks, organizations, public gatherings, and educational institutions, where maintaining security and tracking attendance are paramount. 
To enhance the capabilities of existing systems, a smart attendance system is proposed, leveraging Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and the OpenCV [3] library in Python. This system utilizes advanced algorithms like Eigen faces and fisher faces for precise face detection and recognition, ensuring accurate attendance marking.  
While deep learning models excel with large datasets, they often struggle with few samples [4]. To overcome this limitation, the system compares input faces with images in the dataset, automatically updating recognized names and timestamps into a CSV file. Additionally, the system allows users to upload a single photo or a group photo, returning matched photos as output using a CNN [5]. This feature enhances the system's flexibility [6] and usability, providing users with a convenient and reliable method for identifying and tracking individuals.
